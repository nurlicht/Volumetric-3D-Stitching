# Volumetric-3D-Stitching
Filling the 3D 'scattering volume' by appropriately-oriented 2D scattering patterns. An analytical model suggests a numerical procedure (using Diffusion Map and the fisrt 9 non-trivial eigenvectors). The Matlab code here 1) synthesizes 2D scattering patterns; 2) Forms the Distance Matrix of mimages; and 3) retrieves the (relative) orientations using the DIstance Matrix.
