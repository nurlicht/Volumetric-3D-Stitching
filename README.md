# Volumetric-3D-Stitching
Filling the 3D 'scattering volume' by appropriately-oriented 2D scattering patterns:
An analytical model (of the forward problem) suggests a numerical procedure (for the inverse problem) using Diffusion Map and the fisrt 9 non-trivial eigenvectors. The Matlab code here
  1) simulates the forward problem and synthesizes 2D scattering patterns;
  2) Forms the Distance Matrix of scattering patterns; and
  3) retrieves the (relative) orientations using the Distance Matrix.
